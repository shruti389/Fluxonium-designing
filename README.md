# Fluxonium-designing
Fluxonium was first proposed by Manucharyan et al in 2009 to solve both the inductance and the offset charge noise problems.The fluxonium qubit, a type of superconducting circuit, is a promising candidate for quantum computation due to its long coherence times and large anharmonicity.Coherence time refers to the duration a qubit can maintain its quantum state, while anharmonicity refers to the difference in energy between the first and second excited states of a qubit. The longer the coherence time and the larger the anharmonicity, the better the qubit is for quantum computation. In the Fluxonium architecture, a series array of large-capacitance tunnel junctions are connected in parallel with a small junction . When the system oscillation frequency is below the plasma frequency, the series array of large junctions effectively behaves as an inductive wire.From a circuit perspective, such a large inductor is equivalent to a low-pass filter. Therefore, the lowfrequency change of the charge across the small junction is short-circuited by this large inductor, which reduces the sensitivity of qubits to charge noise.However, the fluxonium qubit is a promising alternative to the transmon due to its attractive properties, including a nearly degenerate ground state and a large anharmonicity.
